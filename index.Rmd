## The model

The predications are made based on a liner model that developed from "mtcars" dataset

```{r block2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
data(mtcars); 
d<-mtcars;#loading data
d$am <- factor(d$am,levels=c(0,1),labels=c("Automatic","Manual")) 
d$cyl <- factor(d$cyl) 
fit <- lm(mpg ~ am+am*cyl,d) #fitting liner model
predict(fit,data.frame(cyl = "6",am="Automatic"))

```
